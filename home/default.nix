    # this shit is painful, there looks to be heaps of work here
    # to get an easy theme changing script working via home-manager
    # seems like my implementation of nix-colors is whack
    # or that using home-manager as a module rather than
    # a standalone package has made this quite a difficult task
    # to accomplish.

    # my modules are a combination of home-manager configs along with standard nix configs.
    # i could look into having configs for programs (activating them) and
    # for home manager, then have the home-manager.nix / host.nix import seperate to eachother
    # that too feels messy, and that there should be a better method for deploying things

    # will spend more time on this when time permits - my main issue
    # currently with my configs / nix-colors is that
    # i have declared my colour scheme in my nix config
    # setting nix-colors scheme in home-manager seems to do
    # nothing at all, unless I'm overlooking something :D
    # to add - i cannot seem to set the colour scheme
    # only in home-manager as my config complains about
    # missing args (colorscheme) not being set
